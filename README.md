# Anomaly Detection Util

## Library code for anomaly detection

in this small excersice, i created a code to be a util tool in the next excersices that will
detect anomalies based on simple statistics methods.

the function implemented are:
* variance- calculates the variance of X
* covariance- calculates the variance of 2 given arrays
* pearson-  calculate the Pearson corelation coefficient
* linear reg- calculates the linear regression
* dev- calculates the deviation
